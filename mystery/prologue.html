        <h1>Welcome to the Piethon Case</h1>
        <p>
            The city's a tangle of wires, code, and coffee stains. You're a
            junior detective, just out of academy. Your first case? The
            suspicious death of Professor Montie Piethonâ€”genius, recluse, and
            Python pioneer. They say it was an accident. You say
            otherwise.\n\nWith only your trench coat, a mug of cold coffee, and
            your terminal, you're about to enter a world where bugs kill, and
            logic saves lives.
